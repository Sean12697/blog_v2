Recently, I received a message from one of my former lecturers on behalf of a student who wished to reestablish the MMU Computing Society. I'll go over the exact advice I gave in this blog post in the hopes that it will be useful to those looking to start student societies.

In broad terms, at the Computing Society, we hosted and promoted events that would be relevant to anyone who wished to learn digital skills, covering topics such as coding, cybersecurity, animation, etc. These covered socials, workshops, hackathons, and other forms of engagement with industry experts, both inside and outside of the University.

**General Advice**

Before I break down the various types of events we used to host and promote at the Computing Society, I will give some general advice for running a society.

Firstly, it only requires two to three people to form a society. At MMU, the minimum requirement is a Chair (the main person) and Treasurer (who handles financial matters, which is honestly not too difficult). Other universities have either the Vice-Chair or Secretary as a requirement as well, whereas at MMU they are optional roles, meaning it will only take yourself and one friend.

Secondly, societies such as the Computing Society usually have a close connection to a facility, which often has staff who have the ability to book out entire rooms for you. You can book a room in the Students Union (through the Students Union) to hold events, but we often found it easier and more convenient to ask a relevant member of staff in the faculty to book a room in the faculty.

Thirdly, societies can have and apply for money. Each university is different. Although it's common for students to have a certain amount of free credit when they start university to spend at the Students' Union, at MMU it was £20. It was common to have a registration fee to join a society, usually between £3 and £5 per member, which is usually spent during Freshers' Fair where students get to be introduced to the various societies they can join. If a society set a £5 registration fee and received 50 members during Freshers Fair, which is not unreasonable, they could have a balance of £250 to spend on anything that can be assigned to the society through the Students Union. Commonly, this would be things to organise events for societies, such as refreshments for socials and hackathons, which I will lead onto.

**Student Socials**

These are usually the simplest types of events to organize; they are often hosted in the Students' Union, a room within the faculty, or a nearby pub. There is often no agenda to these types of events; depending on where they are hosted, we would order pizza via the Students' Union using the society's money, run a gaming session, such as an Unreal Tournament, or have discussions over a pint and burger.

**Workshops**

Various organisers of the Computing Society used to host "Intro to x", such as introductions to "HTML & CSS", "Git & Github", "Cryptography" and much more, which we used to develop ourselves based on the interests and experiences of the different individuals that used to run the society.

We also contacted other lectures within the faculty to see if they had workshops that they could teach under the Computing Society; they were happy to do so. One example of this is An Introduction to Lua by Huw Lloyd.

Outside of events we used to host, either being taught by ourselves or staff within the faculty, we also used to promote other such activities and events that would be of interest to those who wanted to learn digital skills. Within MMU, we have the Science and Engineering Extra-Curricular Awards, which hosts a number of such events.

**Industry Experts**

The best events, which included talks from experts in the field, were outside ones on Meetup and Eventbrite. We promoted these events, which eventually led to the [CompiledMCR](https://compiledmcr.com/) platform, which I made in 2017 when I was in my second year of Univeristy as a Computer Science student to aggregate events.

On the topic of Meetups, at MMU we specifically had an event called "Meet the Meetups" organised by Richard Eskins, which happened from approximately 18:00 to 21:00, introducing around a dozen organisers of such community groups across a variety of different topics, usually hosting regular events that could be attended by students.

Beyond external events, at the MMU Computing Society we also specifically organised a yearly event called "Get in the Game", which was targeted at Games Design & Development and Games Technology students, bringing in experts to give general advice and conduct CV reviews.
